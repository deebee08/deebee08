ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @deebee08! Iâ€™m interested in all things machine learning, app dev, and making tech to help the environment. Currently diving into activation functions (teaching my model to think...sort of). Looking to collaborate on any project that mixes ML, sustainability, and maybe a dash of creativity! Fun fact: I once built a makeshift water filter out of a coffee canâ€”didnâ€™t go as planned, but hey, innovation starts somewhere!
